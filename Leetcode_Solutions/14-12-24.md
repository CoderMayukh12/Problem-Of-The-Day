**Problem Link**: [Leetcode - Continuous Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/continuous-subarrays/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-12-14)

## 1. **Initial Approach** (Failed due to duplicates)

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long continuousSubarrays(vector<int>& nums) {
        long long sum = 0;
        int low = 0, high = 0;

        while (low < nums.size()) {
            int diff = 0; // Initialize diff to avoid uninitialized use
            
            if (high < nums.size()) { 
                diff = abs(nums[low] - nums[high]); 
            }
            
            if (high == nums.size() || diff > 2) {
                // Reset high to start from the next position of low
                high = low + 1;
                low++;
            } else {
                sum++; // Valid subarray
                high++;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```

### **Explanation of Initial Approach**:
This approach attempts to count the number of continuous subarrays where the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum elements is at most 2. However, it fails to account for duplicates in the array.

#### Key Steps in the Code:
1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `sum`: Tracks the count of valid subarrays.
   - `low` and `high`: Represent the starting and ending indices of the current subarray.
   
2. **Iterate Over the Array**:
   - The outer loop iterates through the array using the `low` pointer to consider each potential starting point of a subarray.

3. **Calculate the Difference**:
   - `diff` is the absolute difference between `nums[low]` and `nums[high]`.

4. **Check Validity of the Subarray**:
   - If `high` exceeds the array bounds or if `diff > 2`, the subarray becomes invalid.
   - Reset `high` to the next position after `low`, and increment `low` to explore new subarrays.
   - If the subarray is valid, increment the count and expand the window by moving `high` forward.

#### **Time Complexity**:
- **Time Complexity**:<code>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</code>in the worst case due to nested exploration of subarrays.
- **Space Complexity**: <code>O(1)</code>, as no extra data structures are used apart from variables.

## 2. **Better Approach (Sliding Window with Range Tracking)**

```cpp
class Solution {
    #define ll long long
    #define pii pair<int,int>
public:
    long long continuousSubarrays(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int left = 0;
        int range_min = INT_MAX;
        int range_max = INT_MIN;

        ll count = 0;
        ll win_size;
        int right;

        for (right = 0; right < n; ++right) {
            range_min = min(range_min, nums[right]);
            range_max = max(range_max, nums[right]);

            if (range_max - range_min > 2) {
                win_size = right - left;
                count += (win_size * (win_size + 1)) / 2;

                left = right;
                // Expand current window to as left as possible
                range_min = nums[right];
                range_max = nums[right];
                while (abs(nums[right] - nums[left - 1]) <= 2) {
                    left--;
                    range_min = min(range_min, nums[left]);
                    range_max = max(range_max, nums[left]);
                }
                // Subtract overcounted subarrays
                if (left < right) {
                    win_size = right - left;
                    count -= (win_size * (win_size + 1)) / 2;
                }
            }
        }

        // Add subarrays from last window
        win_size = right - left;
        count += (win_size * (win_size + 1)) / 2;

        return count;
    }
};
```

### **Explanation of Better Approach**:
This solution uses a sliding window approach to efficiently track the minimum and maximum elements in the current window and count valid subarrays where the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum elements is at most 2.

#### Key Steps in the Solution:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `left`: Marks the start of the sliding window.
   - `range_min` and `range_max`: Track the minimum and maximum elements in the current window.
   - `count`: Stores the total count of valid subarrays.
   - `win_size`: Represents the size of the current sliding window.

2. **Sliding Window Expansion**:
   - The `right` pointer iterates through the array to expand the window.
   - For each new element `nums[right]`, update `range_min` and `range_max` to reflect the new minimum and maximum in the window.

3. **Check Validity**:
   - If `range_max - range_min > 2`, the current window becomes invalid.
   - Calculate and add the valid subarrays count from the current window before resetting.

4. **Expand Window to Include Previous Elements**:
   - Attempt to expand the window leftward by including previous elements, ensuring the absolute difference between elements remains ≤ 2.

5. **Final Adjustment**:
   - After the loop, add the subarrays from the last valid window to the total count.

#### **Core Logic**:
- The sliding window ensures that we efficiently explore all valid subarrays.
- Resetting the window allows us to skip over invalid configurations without revisiting them.

#### **Time Complexity**:
- **Time Complexity**: <code>O(n)</code>, as each element is processed at most twice (once by `right` and potentially again by `left`).
- **Space Complexity**: <code>O(1)</code>, as we only use a constant amount of extra memory.

## 3. **Another Approach using Multiset**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    multiset<int> mt;

    bool check(int val) {
        mt.insert(val);
        int mn = *mt.begin();
        int mx = *mt.rbegin();
        int diff = abs(mx - mn);
        mt.erase(mt.find(val));
        return diff <= 2;
    }

    long long continuousSubarrays(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int head = -1, tail = 0;
        mt.clear();
        long long ans = 0;
        
        while (tail < n) {
            while (head + 1 < n && check(nums[head + 1])) {
                head++;
                mt.insert(nums[head]);
            }
            ans += head - tail + 1;
            if (tail <= head) {
                mt.erase(mt.find(nums[tail]));
                tail++;
            } else {
                tail++;
                head = tail - 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### **Explanation of Multiset Approach**:
This approach uses a sliding window with a `multiset` to track the elements of the current subarray, which allows for efficient calculation of the minimum and maximum values within the window.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Sliding Window**:
   - The `tail` and `head` pointers represent the subarray.
   
2. **Multiset**:
   - The `multiset` stores the current elements of the window in sorted order, making it easy to get the minimum (`*mt.begin()`) and maximum (`*mt.rbegin()`) values.
   
3. **Expand Window**:
   - The `head` pointer moves forward as long as the condition `max - min ≤ 2` holds.

4. **Count Valid Subarrays**:
   - For each `tail`, add the count of valid subarrays ending at `head` to the result.

5. **Move Tail**:
   - Adjust the `tail` pointer and remove elements from the multiset as necessary.

#### **Time Complexity**:
- **Time Complexity**: <code>O(nlogn)</code>, due to the multiset operations (insert, erase, access min/max).
- **Space Complexity**: <code>O(n)</code>, due to the multiset storing elements in the current window.
